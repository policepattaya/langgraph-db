    connectionString: 'your_connection_string_here'
});

// Store short-term memory
memory.storeShortTerm('key', 'value');

// Retrieve short-term memory
const value = memory.retrieveShortTerm('key');
console.log(value); // Output: value

// Store long-term memory
memory.storeLongTerm('key', 'persistent_value');

// Retrieve long-term memory
const persistentValue = memory.retrieveLongTerm('key');
console.log(persistentValue); // Output: persistent_value
```
